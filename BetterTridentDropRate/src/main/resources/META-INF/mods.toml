In Minecraft Java Edition, the droprate for the trident is obscenely lower than it is in bedrock edition for no real discernable reason.
Not only that, but fewer mobs drop it, as only the drowned who spawn with tridents will actually drop one.
This contrasts with Bedrock Edition's way of doing it where all drowned have a chance to drop it. To me, there is no logical reason for this.
The trident, while good, is no where near as powerful as, say a netherite sword, but is, in my opinion, significantly more difficult to obtain.
This mod seeks to fix that. It is extremely simple, and only tweaks the drop rate numbers of tridents, as well as the mobs who can drop them.
With this mod, all drowneds now have a chance to drop a trident, and it is slightly higher than it is in the base game of Java Edition.
